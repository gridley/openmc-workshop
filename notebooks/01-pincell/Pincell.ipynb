OpenMC represents physical volumes using constructive solid geometry (CSG), also known as combinatorial geometry. The object that allows us to assign a material to a region of space is called a `Cell` (same concept in MCNP, for those familiar). There are four major stages in building a cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Surfaces\n",

    "Between those three classes of surfaces (planes, cylinders, spheres), one can construct a wide variety of models. It is also possible to define cones and general second-order surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Half-Spaces\n",
    "Note that defining a surface is not sufficient to specify a volume -- in order to define an actual volume, one must reference the half-space of a surface. A surface *half-space* is the region whose points satisfy a positive or negative inequality of the surface equation. For example, for a sphere of radius one centered at the origin, the surface equation is $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 1 = 0$. Thus, we say that the negative half-space of the sphere, is defined as the collection of points satisfying $f(x,y,z) < 0$, which one can reason is the inside of the sphere. Conversely, the positive half-space of the sphere would correspond to all points outside of the sphere.\n",

Instead though, we create `Plot` instances, assign them to a `Plots` collection, export it to XML, and then run OpenMC in geometry plotting mode. As an example, let's specify that we want the plot to be colored by material (rather than by cell) and we assign yellow to fuel and blue to water."
